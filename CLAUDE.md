# CLAUDE.md — PADELEANDO

## Project Overview

PADELEANDO is a full-stack web app for managing padel tennis tournaments. It supports two tournament formats (Liga/Americano), two modes (Free players/Fixed pairs), live match tracking, standings, stats, invitations, and public sharing of tournaments. Users have public profiles with personal stats (win %, streaks, recent matches, frequent partners, americano championships). Premium accounts unlock extra features (photo galleries, avatar uploads). An admin dashboard is available to users with `role = 'admin'`.

## Architecture

```
Browser
  └── React App (AuthContext + ThemeContext)
        └── React Router routes
              └── Components
                    └── useTournament hook  ←→  src/utils/api.js  →  Express API  →  Neon DB
                                                                                  →  Cloudinary (images)
```

- **`src/utils/api.js`** is the single API client. It handles auth token refresh on 401 automatically. All HTTP calls must go through it.
- **`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`** wraps the entire app and provides `user`, `login()`, `logout()`, `isLoggedIn`.
- **`src/hooks/useTournament.js`** is the central hook for all tournament operations (matches, players, pairs, scores, bracket). Components should use this hook rather than calling `api.js` directly.
- **`src/utils/helpers.js`** normalizes API responses (`adaptTournament`, `adaptMatch`, `adaptPair`), patches stale bracket names (`patchBracketNames`), and calculates standings client-side (`calcStandings`).

---

## Key Conventions

### API Calls
- **Never use `fetch()` directly in components.** All API calls go through `src/utils/api.js`.
- The api wrapper handles 401 → token refresh → retry automatically.
- Multipart (file upload) calls use `reqMultipart()` internally — exposed as `api.auth.uploadAvatar`, `api.photos.upload`.

### Data Normalization
- API responses are always normalized through adapter functions in `helpers.js` before use:
  - `adaptTournament(t)` — normalize tournament; resolves `linked_name`, patches bracket names
  - `adaptMatch(m)` — normalize match
  - `adaptPair(p)` — normalize pair

### Name Resolution (`linked_name` pattern)
- When a user accepts an invitation, their player slot gains a `user_id` link. From that point on, the backend returns `u.name AS linked_name` alongside `p.name` for all player queries.
- `adaptTournament` resolves every player to `linked_name ?? name`, so components always show the real account name.
- Bracket names are baked into the stored JSONB. `patchBracketNames` (called inside `adaptTournament`) re-derives all pair/winner names from the current player list, fixing stale stored names retroactively.
- Consequence: **all name resolution happens in `adaptTournament`**. Backend queries must include `LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = p.user_id` and `u.name AS linked_name` wherever players are fetched.

### Standings
- Always calculated **client-side** with `calcStandings(players, matches)` from `helpers.js`.
- Sorted by: wins → point differential → points for.
- In americano format, the champion is determined by `bracket.final.winner_id`, not the standings table.
- **A match never ends in a draw.** There is no such thing in padel: `MatchForm` won't let you save one, `POST/PUT /matches` reject `score1 === score2`, and `calcStandings` discards any equal score it finds (legacy rows only) instead of awarding it to anyone.

### Stats
Three surfaces, all fed from the same primitives — keep them consistent with each other:

- **Tournament** (`Stats.jsx` › "Este torneo") and **category** (› "Históricas", premium gates the advanced block) are computed client-side from `players` + `matches`.
- **Profile** (`GET /groups/user/:username`) is computed in SQL, plus in-memory merges in `lib/profileStats.js`.

Rules that keep the three from drifting:

- **Americano knockout matches are not in the `matches` table** — they live inside `tournaments.bracket` (JSONB). Any stat that counts matches must expand them: `getAllMatches` on the client, `expandBracketMatches` on the profile. Forgetting this is why the profile used to show a championship whose matches didn't exist.
- **Group historical stats must key on player identity, not on `players.id` or on the name.** The same person gets a new `players` row per jornada, and names repeat: use `linked_username` when the slot is linked, the normalized name otherwise (`playerKey` in `Stats.jsx`).
- **Never re-derive a winner by parsing a label** — `getTournamentWinners(t)` returns the winning player ids; `getTournamentWinnerLabel` is just its join. Names contain `&`.
- **Titles count every format.** `stats.titulos` = `titulos_liga` (derived from each finished tournament's standings) + `campeon_americano` (from the bracket final).
- **The winrate ranking is smoothed** (`rankedWinRate`, prior of 2 matches toward the category mean) so a 1-0 record doesn't outrank an 18-4 one. The table still displays the real percentage.
- Neon returns `DATE` columns as JS `Date` objects: use `dayKey()` before comparing or sorting them as strings.
- **A tournament's date is `tournamentDate(t)`**, not `created_at` — the jornada is usually loaded a few days after it was played (13 of 28 tournaments differ, by up to 13 days). Order is `event_date` → first `played_at` → `created_at`.
- Anything that walks the whole history per jornada (rank-per-jornada, head to head) must accumulate in **one** pass; recomputing the ranking for each jornada is quadratic. `buildRankHistory` and `buildHeadToHead` measure 1 ms at 100 jornadas.

**Check the data before building a stat**, and when the data isn't there yet, ship the stat hidden rather than wrong. Three of these currently compute to zero on purpose and light up on their own:

- **Sets** (`countSetStats`) only counts best-of-three matches and returns `disponible: false` while none exist — with one set, "sets won" equals "matches won" and a comeback is impossible. `sets` is filled on 18% of matches and none has used the 3-set format yet.
- **Blowout** = 6-0, or every set 6-0 in a best-of-three (`countBlowouts`). No 6-0 exists yet: matches are played to 3, 4 or 6 games, so the shutouts on record are 1-0, 3-0 and 5-0. Do **not** replace this with a games-difference threshold — that was tried and a `>= 4` matched 2% of matches while "loser scored zero" would flag a 1-0.
- **Follow ranking** (`buildFollowRanking`) compares the user against the people they follow; it needs 2+ people with matches to render, and today there are 2 follows in the whole database. It adds each user's knockout matches so the numbers match their profile.
- `ajustados` (1-game margin) is the one "close match" measure that means the same at any match length — 41% of matches qualify.
- `duration_seconds` covers 69% of matches, so anything derived from it must say how many matches it measured.
- Leagues run on a fixed weekday: the profile's weekday chart only renders with 3+ active days, otherwise it is five empty bars.

**The profile's advanced stats are gated server-side.** `GET /groups/user/:username` returns them only to the owner, or to anyone if a premium user opted in via `users.advanced_stats_public` (default `false`). The queries that only feed that block are skipped entirely when it won't render. The frontend's `canSeeAdvanced` mirrors the same rule for the UI and the profile snapshot, but it is cosmetic — the payload is the source of truth, so don't put those fields back into the public response.

### Theming
- Theme variables live in `src/index.css` as CSS custom properties under `@theme`.
- Dark mode is the **default**. Light mode adds the `.light` class to `<html>`.
- Use `--color-brand` (lime yellow `#e8f04a`) for primary accent, `--color-surface` for card backgrounds.
- Never hardcode colors — always use the CSS variables.

### Routing & Auth
- Protected routes use the `<PrivateRoute>` component wrapper in `App.jsx`.
- Admin-only routes use `<AdminRoute>` (checks `user.role === 'admin'`).
- Group/tournament URLs use the `/cat/` prefix (e.g. `/cat/:groupId/torneo/:tournamentId`).
- Public routes include: `/`, `/login`, `/register`, `/u/:username`, `/view/:id` (old `/readonly/:id` redirects here), `/tutorial`, `/cat/:groupId`, `/verify-email/:token`, `/reset-password/:token`, `/invitacion/:token`.

### Permissions & Co-organizers
- A category (`groups`) has one **owner** (`groups.user_id`) plus zero or more **co-organizers** (`group_collaborators`). A tournament/jornada has no owner of its own — it inherits from its category.
- Two permission levels, both computed server-side and returned on `GET /groups/:id` and `GET /tournaments/:id`:
  - **`is_owner`** — owner only. Gates owner-exclusive actions: edit/delete the category, transfer ownership, manage co-organizers.
  - **`can_manage`** — owner **or** co-organizer. Gates all jornada management (create/edit/delete jornadas, players, pairs, matches, bracket, photos).
- The frontend `isOwner` returned by `useTournament` now means `can_manage`. In `GroupView`, use `is_owner` for owner-only UI and `can_manage` for jornada management.
- **Authorization is enforced server-side**: mutating tournament/match/pair/player endpoints use `requireAuth` + guards from `middleware/access.js` (`requireTournamentManage`, `requireGroupManage`, etc.), backed by `lib/access.js#canManageGroup`. Do not rely on the frontend alone.
- **Plan/premium gates key off the category owner**, never the acting user: a premium co-organizer does not bypass a basic owner's limits (e.g. the free monthly-tournament cap, photo uploads).
- Invites (co-organizer and ownership transfer) go by `@username`/email (in-app notification) or by shareable link (`/invitacion/:token`). Ownership transfer is irreversible and only completes when the recipient accepts; the previous owner becomes a co-organizer. See `routes/collaborators.js`.

### Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind 4 is configured via the Vite plugin only — there is no `tailwind.config.js`.
- Custom theme values are defined in `src/index.css` using `@theme {}`.

### Component Organization
- Feature components live in `src/components/<Feature>/`.
- Shared/reusable components live in `src/components/shared/`.
- New components should follow the existing file-per-component pattern.

## Performance

A July 2026 audit took the four main routes from 36–78 to 85–95 on mobile Lighthouse. **Every change must be evaluated for performance impact before it is considered done** — those gains disappear on their own if new features reintroduce the patterns below. Each one is a real regression this codebase already paid for.

### Patterns to check before finishing a change

- **Heavy static imports.** Recharts is 111 KB over the wire. If a component sits behind a tab, below the fold, or behind a narrow condition, load it with `React.lazy`. If it also sits at the bottom of a long page, wrap it in `WhenVisible` (`src/components/shared/WhenVisible.jsx`), which mounts it only as it approaches the viewport.
- **Chained `await`s on queries.** With the Neon HTTP driver every `sql` tagged template is its own round-trip to São Paulo. Queries that don't feed each other belong in one `Promise.all`. This was the single most repeated problem in the audit: the public profile went from ~11 serial round-trips to 2, `GET /groups/:id` from 7 to 3.
- **A second request that depends on the first.** Prefer returning those fields in the first response — it saves the round-trip *and* stops the data from arriving late and injecting content. See `/readonly/:id`, which now carries the category's name, emojis and visibility.
- **Content that mounts above something already visible.** It pushes the page down and counts as CLS. Either reserve its height from the first render, or make the data arrive with the rest.
- **Loading states shorter than the real content.** If the placeholder leaves the footer inside the viewport, the real content evicts it and that alone can cost 0.7 CLS. Pages whose content always exceeds the viewport should reserve `min-h-screen` (or `<Loader minHeight="100vh" />`).
- **Images.** Always set `width`/`height`. Cloudinary images go through URL transformations (`f_auto,q_auto,w_N,c_limit`) — untransformed banners were 97% of the mobile page weight.

### Verifying

Do not claim an improvement without measuring it — reading the code is not enough, and several "obvious" hypotheses in the audit turned out to be false when executed.

- Measure in a real browser against the **production build**, never the dev server: `npm run preview` serves bundled chunks, the dev server serves loose modules and proves nothing about code splitting. Confirm the HTML requests `/assets/index-*.js`, not `/@vite/client`.
- Confirm the page actually rendered its data before trusting any number. A page that failed to load looks fast.
- Diagnose CLS with `PerformanceObserver` on `layout-shift` entries, reading `previousRect`/`currentRect`. The obvious suspect is usually not the cause.
- When touching an endpoint, diff the response against the previous code with keys normalized — byte-identical output is the bar.

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't bypass `api.js`** — the token refresh logic lives there; skipping it breaks auth.
- **Don't add subscription/payment UI** — the Subscription feature is intentionally disabled (components exist but routes are commented out in App.jsx).
- **Don't store auth tokens in localStorage** — tokens use httpOnly cookies; only the `user` object (no secrets) is stored in localStorage.
- **Don't use a `tailwind.config.js`** — Tailwind 4 doesn't use one; extend the theme via `@theme {}` in `index.css`.
- **Don't calculate standings server-side** — standings are always derived client-side.
- **Don't allow or model draws** — padel has no draws; a match with `score1 === score2` is invalid data, not a result to display.
- **Don't count matches without expanding the americano bracket** — knockout matches are not rows in `matches`. See [Stats](#stats).
- **Don't group historical player stats by name** — group by identity (`linked_username` ?? normalized name); a player's `players.id` changes every jornada.
- **Don't show a "CAMPEONES" banner in americano tournaments** — champion is determined by the bracket final, not standings.
- **Don't hardcode player names** — always go through `adaptTournament` / `linked_name` pattern so invited users see their real name.
- **Don't let co-organizers edit or delete a category** — those (plus transfer and managing co-organizers) are owner-only (`is_owner`). Co-organizers manage jornadas only (`can_manage`).
- **Don't gate plan limits on the acting user** — evaluate premium/quota against the **category owner** (`groups.user_id` / `owner_is_premium`).
- **Don't chain `await`ed queries that don't depend on each other** — each one is a separate round-trip on the Neon HTTP driver. Batch them with `Promise.all`. See [Performance](#performance).
- **Don't import charting libraries statically** — Recharts must always be reached through `React.lazy`, otherwise it lands in the initial bundle of every route that touches it.
